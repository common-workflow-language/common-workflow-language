      # Abstract

      A Workflow is an analysis task represented by a directed graph describing
      a sequence of operations that transform an input data set to output.
      This specification defines the Common Workflow Language (CWL) Workflow
      description, a vendor-neutral standard for representing workflows
      intended to be portable across a variety of computing platforms.

      ## Introduction to draft 3

      This specification represents the third milestone of the CWL group.  Since
      draft-2, this draft introduces the following changes and additions:

        * Greatly simplified naming within a document with scoped identifiers, as
          described in the [Schema Salad specification](SchemaSalad.html).
        * The draft-2 concept of pluggable expression engines has been replaced
          by a [streamlined expression syntax)[#Parameter_references]
          and standardization on [Javascript](#Expressions).
        * [File](#File) objects can now include a `format` field to indicate
          the file type.
        * The addition of [MultipleInputFeatureRequirement](#MultipleInputFeatureRequirement).
        * The addition of [StepInputExpressionRequirement](#StepInputExpressionRequirement).
        * The separation of Workflow and CommandLineTool components into
          separate specifications.

      ## Purpose

      The Common Workflow Language Command Line Tool Description express
      workflows for data-intensive science, such as Bioinformatics, Chemistry,
      Physics, and Astronomy.  This specification is intended to define a data
      and execution model for Workflows that can be implemented on top of a
      variety of computing platforms, ranging from an individual workstation to
      cluster, grid, cloud, and high performance computing systems.

- type: record
  name: WorkflowStepInput
  extends: "#Sink"
  docParent: "#WorkflowStep"
  doc: |
    The input of a workflow step connects an upstream parameter (from the
    workflow inputs, or the outputs of other workflows steps) with the input
    parameters of the underlying process.

    ## Input object

    A WorkflowStepInput object must contain an `id` field in the form
    `#fieldname` or `#stepname.fieldname`.  When the `id` field contains a
    period `.` the field name consists of the characters following the final
    period.  This defines a field of the workflow step input object with the
    value of the `source` parameter(s).

    ## Merging

    To merge multiple inbound data links,
    [MultipleInputFeatureRequirement](#MultipleInputFeatureRequirement) must be specified
    in the workflow or workflow step requirements.

    If the sink parameter is an array, or named in a [workflow
    scatter](#WorkflowStep) operation, there may be multiple inbound data links
    listed in the `source` field.  The values from the input links are merged
    depending on the method specified in the `linkMerge` field.  If not
    specified, the default method is "merge_nested".

    * **merge_nested**

      The input must be an array consisting of exactly one entry for each
      input link.  If "merge_nested" is specified with a single link, the value
      from the link must be wrapped in a single-item list.

    * **merge_flattened**

      1. The source and sink parameters must be compatible types, or the source
         type must be compatible with single element from the "items" type of
         the destination array parameter.
      2. Source parameters which are arrays are concatenated.
         Source parameters which are single element types are appended as
         single elements.

  fields:
    - name: id
      type: string
      jsonldPredicate: "@id"
      doc: "A unique identifier for this workflow input parameter."
    - name: default
      type: ["null", Any]
      doc: |
        The default value for this parameter if there is no `source`
        field.
      jsonldPredicate: "cwl:default"
    - name: valueFrom
      type:
        - "null"
        - "string"
        - "#Expression"
      jsonldPredicate: "cwl:valueFrom"
      doc: |
        To use valueFrom, [StepInputExpressionRequirement](#StepInputExpressionRequirement) must
        be specified in the workflow or workflow step requirements.

        If `valueFrom` is a constant string value, use this as the value for
        this input parameter.

        If `valueFrom` is a parameter reference or expression, it must be
        evaluated to yield the actual value to be assiged to the input field.

        The `self` value of in the parameter reference or expression must be
        the value of the parameter(s) specified in the `source` field, or
        null if there is no `source` field.

        The value of `inputs` in the parameter reference or expression is the
        input object to the workflow step after assigning the `source` values,
        but before evaluating any step with `valueFrom`.  The order of
        evaluating `valueFrom` among step input parameters is undefined.


- type: record
  name: WorkflowStepOutput
  docParent: "#WorkflowStep"
  doc: |
    Associate an output parameter of the underlying process with a workflow
    parameter.  The workflow parameter (given in the `id` field) be may be used
    as a `source` to connect with input parameters of other workflow steps, or
    with an output parameter of the process.
  fields:
    - name: id
      type: string
      jsonldPredicate: "@id"
      doc: |
        A unique identifier for this workflow output parameter.  This is the
        identifier to use in the `source` field of `WorkflowStepInput` to
        connect the output value to downstream parameters.


- name: ScatterMethod
  type: enum
  docParent: "#WorkflowStep"
  doc: The scatter method, as described in [workflow step scatter](#WorkflowStep).
  symbols:
    - dotproduct
    - nested_crossproduct
    - flat_crossproduct


- name: WorkflowStep
  type: record
  docParent: "#Workflow"
  doc: |
    A workflow step is an executable element of a workflow.  It specifies the
    underlying process implementation (such as `CommandLineTool`) in the `run`
    field and connects the input and output parameters of the underlying
    process to workflow parameters.

    # Scatter/gather

    To use scatter/gather,
    [ScatterFeatureRequirement](#ScatterFeatureRequirement) must be specified
    in the workflow or workflow step requirements.

    A "scatter" operation specifies that the associated workflow step or
    subworkflow should execute separately over a list of input elements.  Each
    job making up a scatter operation is independent and may be executed
    concurrently.

    The `scatter` field specifies one or more input parameters which will be
    scattered.  An input parameter may be listed more than once.  The declared
    type of each input parameter is implicitly wrapped in an array for each
    time it appears in the `scatter` field.  As a result, upstream parameters
    which are connected to scattered parameters may be arrays.

    All output parameter types are also implicitly wrapped in arrays.  Each job
    in the scatter results in an entry in the output array.

    If `scatter` declares more than one input parameter, `scatterMethod`
    describes how to decompose the input into a discrete set of jobs.

      * **dotproduct** specifies that each of the input arrays are aligned and one
          element taken from each array to construct each job.  It is an error
          if all input arrays are not the same length.

      * **nested_crossproduct** specifies the Cartesian product of the inputs,
          producing a job for every combination of the scattered inputs.  The
          output must be nested arrays for each level of scattering, in the
          order that the input arrays are listed in the `scatter` field.

      * **flat_crossproduct** specifies the Cartesian product of the inputs,
          producing a job for every combination of the scattered inputs.  The
          output arrays must be flattened to a single level, but otherwise listed in the
          order that the input arrays are listed in the `scatter` field.

    # Subworkflows

    To specify a nested workflow as part of a workflow step,
    [SubworkflowFeatureRequirement](#SubworkflowFeatureRequirement) must be
    specified in the workflow or workflow step requirements.

  fields:
    - name: id
      type: string
      jsonldPredicate: "@id"
      doc: "The unique identifier for this workflow step."
    - name: inputs

        values.  Input parameters include a schema for each parameter which is
        used to validate the input object.  It may also be used build a user
        interface for constructing the input object.

        listed which is not recognized by the implementation, it is a fatal
        error and the implementation must not attempt to run the process,
        unless overridden at user option.

  doc: |
    A workflow describes a set of **steps** and the **dependencies** between
    those processes.  When a process produces output that will be consumed by a
    second process, the first process is a dependency of the second process.

    When there is a dependency, the workflow engine must execute the preceeding
    process and wait for it to successfully produce output before executing the
    dependent process.  If two processes are defined in the workflow graph that
    are not directly or indirectly dependent, these processes are
    **independent**, and may execute in any order or execute concurrently.  A
    workflow is complete when all steps have been executed.

    Dependencies between parameters are expressed using the `source` field on
    [workflow step input parameters](#WorkflowStepInput) and [workflow output
    parameters](#WorkflowOutputParameter).

    The `source` field expresses the dependency of one parameter on another
    such that when a value is associated with the parameter specified by
    `source`, that value is propagated to the destination parameter.  When all
    data links inbound to a given step are fufilled, the step is ready to
    execute.

    ## Workflow success and failure

    A completed process must result in one of `success`, `temporaryFailure` or
    `permanentFailure` states.  An implementation may choose to retry a process
    execution which resulted in `temporaryFailure`.  An implementation may
    choose to either continue running other steps of a workflow, or terminate
    immediately upon `permanentFailure`.

    * If any step of a workflow execution results in `permanentFailure`, then the
    workflow status is `permanentFailure`.

    * If one or more steps result in `temporaryFailure` and all other steps
    complete `success` or are not executed, then the workflow status is
    `temporaryFailure`.

    * If all workflow steps are executed and complete with `success`, then the workflow
    status is `success`.

    [SubworkflowFeatureRequirement](#SubworkflowFeatureRequirement) are
