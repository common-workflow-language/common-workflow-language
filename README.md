The Common Workflow Language (CWL) is a specification for describing analysis
workflows and tools in a way that makes them portable and scalable across a\
variety of software and hardware environments, from workstations to cluster,
cloud, and high performance computing (HPC) environments.  CWL is designed to
meet the needs of data-intensive science, such as Bioinformatics, Medical
Imaging, Astronomy, Physics, and Chemistry.

CWL is developed by a multi-vendor working group consisting of
organizations and individuals aiming to enable scientists to share data
analysis workflows.  [The CWL project is maintained on
Github](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/common-workflow-language)
and we follow the [Open-Stand.org principles for collaborative open standards development](https://open-stand.org/about-us/principles/).
Legally, CWL is a member project of [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2018/apr/11/cwl-new-member-project/)
and is formally managed by the elected [CWL leadership team](#Leadership_Team),
however every-day project decisions are made by the [CWL community](#Support)
which is open for participation by anyone.

CWL builds on technologies such as [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org)
for data modeling and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for portable runtime
environments.
