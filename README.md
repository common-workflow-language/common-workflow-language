Common Workflow Language
========================

The Common Workflow Language (CWL) is an informal, multi-vendor working group
consisting of various organizations and individuals that have an interest in
portability of data analysis workflows.  Our goal is to create specifications
that enable data scientists to describe analysis tools and workflows that are
powerful, easy to use, portable, and support reproducibility.

CWL builds on technologies such as [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org) and
[Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) for data modeling and
[Docker](http://docker.com) for portable runtime environments.

CWL is designed to express workflows for data-intensive science, such as
Bioinformatics, Chemistry, Physics, and Astronomy.

## CWL Specification

The current stable specification is draft 2:

http://common-workflow-language.github.io/draft-2/

The current work in progress specification is draft 3:

http://common-workflow-language.github.io/draft-3/

## Implementations

Implementations working on or currently capable of running the Common Workflow Language:

* [Reference implementation (Python)](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/common-workflow-language/tree/master/reference/)
* [Rabix](https://github.com/rabix/rabix)
* [Arvados](https://arvados.org)
* [Parallel Recipes](https://github.com/yvdriess/precipes)

## Examples

[Github repository of example tools and workflows.](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/workflows)

## Development and testing

The CWL effort is on Github:

https://github.com/common-workflow-language/common-workflow-language

There is a Jenkins server maintained by Curoverse that runs tests for the
reference implementation, builds and uploads packages, and builds and uploads
Docker images:
