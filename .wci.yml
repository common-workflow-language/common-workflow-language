  The Common Workflow Language (CWL) is an open standard for describing analysis workflows and tools 
  in a way that makes them portable and scalable across a variety of software and hardware environments, 
  from workstations to cluster, cloud, and high performance computing (HPC) environments. 
  CWL is designed to meet the needs of data-intensive science, such as Bioinformatics, Medical Imaging, 
  Astronomy, High Energy Physics, and Machine Learning.
  
  Multiple engines implements the CWL standard, making the workflows executable and interoperable with minimal or no changes.
