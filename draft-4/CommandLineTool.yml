      # Abstract

      A Command Line Tool is a non-interactive executable program that reads
      some input, performs a computation, and terminates after producing some
      output.  Command line programs are a flexible unit of code sharing and
      reuse, unfortunately the syntax and input/output semantics among command
      line programs is extremely heterogeneous. A common layer for describing
      the syntax and semantics of programs can reduce this incidental
      complexity by providing a consistent way to connect programs together.
      This specification defines the Common Workflow Language (CWL) Command
      Line Tool Description, a vendor-neutral standard for describing the
      syntax and input/output semantics of command line programs.

      ## Introduction to draft 4

      This specification represents the third milestone of the CWL group.
      Since draft-3, this draft introduces the following major changes and additions:

      ## Purpose

      Standalone programs are a flexible and interoperable form of code reuse.
      Unlike monolithic applications, applications and analysis workflows which
      are composed of multiple separate programs can be written in multiple
      languages and execute concurrently on multiple hosts.  However, POSIX
      does not dictate computer-readable grammar or semantics for program input
      and output, resulting in extremely heterogeneous command line grammar and
      input/output semantics among program.  This a particular problem in
      distributed computing (multi-node compute clusters) and virtualized
      environments (such as Docker containers) where it is often necessary to
      provision resources such as input files before executing the program.

      Often this is gap is filled by hard coding program invocation and
      implicitly assuming requirements will be met, or abstracting program
      invocation with wrapper scripts or descriptor documents.  Unfortunately,
      where these approaches are application or platform specific it creates a
      significant barrier to reproducibility and portability, as methods
      developed for one platform must be manually ported to be used on new
      platforms.  Similarly it creates redundant work, as wrappers for popular
      tools must be rewritten for each application or platform in use.

      The Common Workflow Language Command Line Tool Description is designed to
      provide a common standard description of grammar and semantics for
      invoking programs used in data-intensive fields such as Bioinformatics,
      Chemistry, Physics, Astronomy, and Statistics.  This specification
      defines a precise data and execution model for Command Line Tools that
      can be implemented on a variety of computing platforms, ranging from a
      single workstation to cluster, grid, cloud, and high performance
      computing platforms.

- type: record
  name: FileDef
  doc: |
    Define a file that must be placed in the designated output directory
    prior to executing the command line tool.  May be the result of executing
    an expression, such as building a configuration file from a template.
  fields:
    - name: "filename"
      type: ["string", "#Expression"]
      doc: "The name of the file to create in the output directory."
    - name: "fileContent"
      type: ["string", "#Expression"]
      doc: |
        If the value is a string literal or an expression which evaluates to a
        string, a new file must be created with the string as the file contents.

        If the value is an expression that evaluates to a File object, this
        indicates the referenced file should be added to the designated output
        directory prior to executing the tool.

        Files added in this way may be read-only, and may be provided
        by bind mounts or file system links to avoid
        unnecessary copying of the input file.


- type: record
  name: EnvironmentDef
  doc: |
    Define an environment variable that will be set in the runtime environment
    by the workflow platform when executing the command line tool.  May be the
    result of executing an expression, such as getting a parameter from input.
  fields:
    - name: "envName"
      type: "string"
      doc: The environment variable name
    - name: "envValue"
      type: ["string", "#Expression"]
      doc: The environment variable value

- type: record
  name: CommandLineBinding
  extends: "#InputBinding"
  doc: |

    When listed under `inputBinding` in the input schema, the term
    "value" refers to the the corresponding value in the input object.  For
    binding objects listed in `CommandLineTool.arguments`, the term "value"
    refers to the effective value after evaluating `valueFrom`.

    The binding behavior when building the command line depends on the data
    type of the value.  If there is a mismatch between the type described by
    the input schema and the effective value, such as resulting from an
    expression evaluation, an implementation must use the data type of the
    effective value.

      - **string**: Add `prefix` and the string to the command line.

      - **number**: Add `prefix` and decimal representation to command line.

      - **boolean**: If true, add `prefix` to the command line.  If false, add
          nothing.

      - **File**: Add `prefix` and the value of
        [`File.path`](#File) to the command line.

      - **array**: If `itemSeparator` is specified, add `prefix` and the join
          the array into a single string with `itemSeparator` separating the
          items.  Otherwise first add `prefix`, then recursively process
          individual elements.

      - **object**: Add `prefix` only, and recursively add object fields for
          which `inputBinding` is specified.

      - **null**: Add nothing.

  fields:
    - name: "position"
      type: ["null", "int"]
      doc: "The sorting key.  Default position is 0."
    - name: "prefix"
      type: [ "null", "string"]
      doc: "Command line prefix to add before the value."
    - name: "separate"
      type: ["null", boolean]
      doc: |
        If true (default), then the prefix and value must be added as separate
        command line arguments; if false, prefix and value must be concatenated
        into a single command line argument.
    - name: "itemSeparator"
      type: ["null", "string"]
      doc: |
        Join the array elements into a single string with the elements
        separated by by `itemSeparator`.
    - name: "valueFrom"
      type:
        - "null"
        - "string"
        - "#Expression"
      jsonldPredicate: "cwl:valueFrom"
      doc: |
        If `valueFrom` is a constant string value, use this as the value and
        apply the binding rules above.

        If `valueFrom` is an expression, evaluate the expression to yield the
        actual value to use to build the command line and apply the binding
        rules above.  If the inputBinding is associated with an input
        parameter, the value of `self` in the expression will be the value of the
        input parameter.

        When a binding is part of the `CommandLineTool.arguments` field,
        the `valueFrom` field is required.
    - name: shellQuote
      type: ["null", boolean]
      doc: |
        If `ShellCommandRequirement` is in the requirements for the current command,
        this controls whether the value is quoted on the command line (default is true).
        Use `shellQuote: false` to inject metacharacters for operations such as pipes.

- type: record
  name: CommandOutputBinding
  extends: "#OutputBinding"
  doc: |
    Describes how to generate an output parameter based on the files produced
    by a CommandLineTool.

    The output parameter is generated by applying these operations in
    the following order:

      - glob
      - loadContents
      - outputEval
  fields:
    - name: glob
      type:
        - "null"
        - string
        - "#Expression"
        - type: array
          items: string
      doc: |
        Find files relative to the output directory, using POSIX glob(3)
        pathname matching.  If provided an array, find files that match any
        pattern in the array.  If provided an expression, the expression must
        return a string or an array of strings, which will then be evaluated as
        one or more glob patterns.  Must only match and return files which
        actually exist.
    - name: loadContents
      type:
        - "null"
        - boolean
      jsonldPredicate: "cwl:loadContents"
      doc: |
        For each file matched in `glob`, read up to
        the first 64 KiB of text from the file and place it in the `contents`
        field of the file object for manipulation by `outputEval`.
    - name: outputEval
      type:
        - "null"
        - string
        - "#Expression"
      doc: |
        Evaluate an expression to generate the output value.  If `glob` was
        specified, the value of `self` must be an array containing file objects
        that were matched.  If no files were matched, `self' must be a zero
        length array; if a single file was matched, the value of `self` is an
        array of a single element.  Additionally, if `loadContents` is `true`,
        the File objects must include up to the first 64 KiB of file contents
        in the `contents` field.

        the designated output directory.

        If `stdout` is a string, it specifies the file name to use.

        If `stdout` is an expression, the expression is evaluated and must

- type: record
  name: DockerRequirement
  extends: "#ProcessRequirement"
  doc: |
    Indicates that a workflow component should be run in a
    [Docker](http://docker.com) container, and specifies how to fetch or build
    the image.

    If a CommandLineTool lists `DockerRequirement` under
    `hints` or `requirements`, it may (or must) be run in the specified Docker
    container.

    The platform must first acquire or install the correct Docker image as
    specified by `dockerPull`, `dockerImport`, `dockerLoad` or `dockerFile`.

    The platform must execute the tool in the container using `docker run` with
    the appropriate Docker image and tool command line.

    The workflow platform may provide input files and the designated output
    directory through the use of volume bind mounts.  The platform may rewrite
    file paths in the input object to correspond to the Docker bind mounted
    locations.

    When running a tool contained in Docker, the workflow platform must not
    assume anything about the contents of the Docker container, such as the
    presence or absence of specific software, except to assume that the
    generated command line represents a valid command within the runtime
    environment of the container.

    ## Interaction with other requirements

    If [EnvVarRequirement](#EnvVarRequirement) is specified alongside a
    DockerRequirement, the environment variables must be provided to Docker
    using `--env` or `--env-file` and interact with the container's preexisting
    environment as defined by Docker.

  fields:
    - name: dockerPull
      type: ["null", "string"]

      doc: "Provide HTTP URL to download and gunzip a Docker images using `docker import."
    - name: dockerImageId
      type: ["null", "string"]
      doc: |
        The image id that will be used for `docker run`.  May be a
        human-readable image name or the image identifier hash.  May be skipped
        if `dockerPull` is specified, in which case the `dockerPull` image id
        must be used.
    - name: dockerOutputDirectory

        items: "#FileDef"
      doc: The list of files.


- name: EnvVarRequirement

- type: record
  name: ShellCommandRequirement
  extends: "#ProcessRequirement"
  doc: |
    Modify the behavior of CommandLineTool to generate a single string
    containing a shell command line.  Each item in the argument list must be
    joined into a string separated by single spaces and quoted to prevent
    intepretation by the shell, unless `CommandLineBinding` for that argument
    contains `shellQuote: false`.  If `shellQuote: false` is specified, the
    argument is joined into the command string without quoting, which allows
    the use of shell metacharacters such as `|` for pipes.


- type: record
  name: ResourceRequirement
  extends: "#ProcessRequirement"
  doc: |
    Specify basic hardware resource requirements.

    "min" is the minimum amount of a resource that must be reserved to schedule
    a job. If "min" cannot be satisfied, the job should not be run.

    "max" is the maximum amount of a resource that the job shall be permitted
    to use. If a node has sufficient resources, multiple jobs may be scheduled
    on a single node provided each job's "max" resource requirements are
    met. If a job attempts to exceed its "max" resource allocation, an
    implementation may deny additional resources, which may result in job
    failure.

    If "min" is specified but "max" is not, then "max" == "min"
    If "max" is specified by "min" is not, then "min" == "max".

    It is an error if max < min.

    It is an error if the value of any of these fields is negative.

    If neither "min" nor "max" is specified for a resource, an implementation may provide a default.
