    # Abstract

    Salad is a schema language for describing structured linked data documents
    in JSON or YAML documents.  A Salad schema provides rules for
    preprocessing, structural validation, and link checking for documents
    described by a Salad schema.  Salad builds on JSON-LD and the Apache Avro
    data serialization system, and extends Avro with features for rich data
    modeling such as inheritance, template specialization, object identifiers,
    and object references.  Salad was developed to provide a bridge between the
    record oriented data modeling supported by Apache Avro and the Semantic
    Web.

    # Introduction

    The JSON data model is an extremely popular way to represent structured
    data.  It is attractive because of it's relative simplicity and is a
    natural fit with the standard types of many programming languages.
    However, this simplicity means that basic JSON lacks expressive features
    useful for working with complex data structures and document formats, such
    as schemas, object references, and namespaces.

    JSON-LD is a W3C standard providing a way to describe how to interpret a
    JSON document as Linked Data by means of a "context".  JSON-LD provides a
    powerful solution for representing object references and namespaces in JSON
    based on standard web URIs, but is not itself a schema language.  Without a
    schema providing a well defined structure, it is difficult to process an
    arbitrary JSON-LD document as idiomatic JSON because there are many ways to
    express the same data that are logically equivalent but structurally
    distinct.

    Several schema languages exist for describing and validating JSON data,
    such as the Apache Avro data serialization system, however none understand
    linked data.  As a result, to fully take advantage of JSON-LD to build the
    next generation of linked data applications, one must maintain separate
    JSON schema, JSON-LD context, RDF schema, and human documentation, despite
    significant overlap of content and obvious need for these documents to stay
    synchronized.

    Schema Salad is designed to address this gap.  It provides a schema
    language and processing rules for describing structured JSON content
    permitting URI resolution and strict document validation.  The schema
    language supports linked data through annotations that describe the linked
    data interpretation of the content, enables generation of JSON-LD context
    and RDF schema, and production of RDF triples by applying the JSON-LD
    context.  The schema language also provides for robust support of inline
    documentation.

    ## Introduction to draft 1

    This is the first version of Schema Salad.  It is developed concurrently
    with draft 3 of the Common Workflow Language for use in specifying the
    Common Workflow Language, however Schema Salad is intended to be useful to
    a broader audience.

    ## Scope

    This document describes the syntax, data model, algorithms, and schema
    language for working with Salad documents.  It is not intended to document
    a specific implementation of Salad, however it may serve as a reference for
    the behavior of conforming implementations.

    ## Terminology

    The terminology used to describe Salad documents is defined in the Concepts
    section of the specification. The terms defined in the following list are
    used in building those definitions and in describing the actions of an
    Salad implementation:

    **may**: Conforming Salad documents and Salad implementations are permitted but
    not required to be interpreted as described.

    **must**: Conforming Salad documents and Salad implementations are required
    to be interpreted as described; otherwise they are in error.

    **error**: A violation of the rules of this specification; results are
    undefined. Conforming implementations may detect and report an error and may
    recover from it.

    **fatal error**: A violation of the rules of this specification; results
    are undefined. Conforming implementations must not continue to process the
    document and may report an error.

    **at user option**: Conforming software may or must (depending on the modal verb in
    the sentence) behave as described; if it does, it must provide users a means to
    enable or disable the behavior described.

    # Document model

    ## Data concepts

    An **object** is a data structure equivalent to the "object" type in JSON,
    consisting of a unordered set of name/value pairs (referred to here as
    **fields**) and where the name is a string and the value is a string, number,
    boolean, array, or object.

    A **document** is a file containing a serialized object, or an array of
    objects.

    A **document type** is a class of files that share a common structure and
    semantics.

    A **document schema** is a formal description of the grammar of a document type.

    A **base URI** is a context-dependent URI used to resolve relative references.

    An **identifier** is a URI that designates a single document or single
    object within a document.

    A **vocabulary** is the set of symbolic field names and enumerated symbols defined
    by a document schema, where each term maps to absolute URI.

    ## Syntax

    Conforming Salad documents are serialized and loaded using YAML syntax and
    UTF-8 text encoding.  Salad documents are written using the JSON-compatible
    subset of YAML.  Features of YAML such as headers and type tags that are
    not found in the standard JSON data model must not be used in conforming
    Salad documents.  It is a fatal error if the document is not valid YAML.

    A Salad document must consist only of either a single root object or an
    array of objects.

    ## Document context

    ### Implied context

    The implicit context consists of the vocabulary defined by the schema and
    the base URI.  By default, the base URI must be the URI that was used to
    load the document.  It may be overidden by an explicit context.

    ### Explicit context

    If a document consists of a single root object, this object may contain the
    field `@context` consisting of a string, object, array of strings, or array
    of objects.  If so, it must be interpreted as a limited form of JSON-LD
    context.  The following JSON-LD directives must be honored:

      * `@base`: set the base URI for the document.

    Additional directives beginning with `@` must be ignored.  The remaining
    vocabulary defined in the context must be interpreted as namespace prefixes
    used during identifier expansion.

    ## Document graph

    If a document consists of a single root object, this object may contain the
    field `@graph` consisting of an array of objects.  If so, the outermost
    document root object the document processed with the contents of `@graph`
    considered the main document.  This permits declaring `@context` at the
    root to cover the whole the document, while logically declaring multiple
    objects at the top level.

    ## Document metadata

    If a document consists of a single root object, metadata about the
    document, such as authorship, may be declared in the root object.

    ## Document schema

    Document preprocessing, link validation and schema validation require a
    document schema.  A schema may consist of:

      * At least one record definition object which defines valid fields that
      make up a record type.  Record field definitions include the valid types
      that may be assigned to each field and annotations to indicate fields
      that represent identifiers and links, described below in "Semantic
      Annotations".

      * Any number of enumerated type objects which define a set of finite set of symbols that are
      valid value of the type.

      * Any number of documentation objects which allow in-line documentation of the schema.

    The schema for defining a salad schema (the metaschema) is described in
    detail in "Schema validation".

    ### Record field annotations

    In a document schema, record field definitions may include the field
    `jsonldPredicate`, which may be either a string or object.  Implementations
    must use the following document preprocessing of fields by the following
    rules:

      * If the value of `jsonldPredicate` is `@id`, the field is an identifier
      field.

      * If the value of `jsonldPredicate` is an object, and contains that
      object contains the field `_type` with the value `@id`, the field is a
      link field.

      * If the value of `jsonldPredicate` is an object, and contains that
      object contains the field `_type` with the value `@vocab`, the field is a
      vocabulary field, which is a subtype of link field.

    ## Document traversal

    To perform document document preprocessing, link validation and schema
    validation, the document must be traversed starting from the fields or
    array items of the root object or array and recursively visiting each child
    item which contains an object or arrays.

    # Document preprocessing

    After processing the explicit context (if any), document preprocessing
    begins.  Starting from the document root, object fields values or array
    items which containin objects or arrays are recursively traversed
    depth-first.  For each visited object, field names, identifier fields, link
    fields, vocabulary fields, and `@import` and `@include` directives must be
    processed as described in this section.  The order of traversal of child
    nodes within a parent node is undefined.

    ## Field name resolution

    The document schema declares the vocabulary of known field names.  During
    preprocessing traversal, field name in the document which are not part of
    the schema vocabulary must be resolved to absolute URIs.  Under "strict"
    validation, it is an error for a document to include fields which are not
    part of the vocabulary and not resolvable to absolute URIs.  Fields names
    which are not part of the vocabulary are resolved using the following
    rules:

      * If an field name URI begins with a namespace prefix declared in the
      document context (`@context`) followed by a colon `:`, the prefix and
      colon must be replaced by the namespace declared in `@context`.

      * If there is a vocabulary term which maps to the URI of a resolved
      field, the field name must be replace with the vocabulary term.

      * If a field name URI is an absolute URI consisting of a scheme and path
      and is not part of the vocabulary, no processing occurs.

    Field name resolution is not relative.  It must not be affected by the base
    URI.

    ### Example

    The `form` field is part of the vocabulary in the following example.  The
    base URI is `http://example.com/base`

    ```
    {
      "@context": {
        "base": "http://example.com/base"
        "acid": "http://example.com/acid#"
      },
      "base": "one",
      "form": {
        "http://example.com/base": "two",
        "http://example.com/extension": "three",
      },
      "acid:extension": "four"
    }

    ```

    Becomes:

    ```
    {
      "base": "one",
      "form": {
        "base": "two",
        "http://example.com/extension": "three",
      },
      "http://example.com/acid#extension": "four"
    }
    ```

    ## Identifier resolution

    The schema may designate one or more fields as identifier fields to
    identify specific objects.  Processing must resolve relative identifiers to
    absolute identifiers using the following rules:

      * If an identifier URI is prefixed with `#` it is a URI relative
      fragment identifier.  It is resolved relative to the base URI by setting
      or replacing the fragment portion of the base URI.

      * If an identifier URI does not contain a scheme and is not prefixed
      `#` it is a parent relative fragment identifier.  It is resolved relative
      to the base URI by the following rule: if the base URI does not contain a
      document fragment, set the fragment portion of the base URI.  If the base
      URI does contain a document fragment, append a slash `/` followed by the
      identifier field to the fragment portion of the base URI.

      * If an identifier URI begins with a namespace prefix declared in
      `@context` followed by a colon `:`, the prefix and colon must be replaced
      by the namespace declared in `@context`.

      * If an identifier URI is an absolute URI consisting of a scheme and
      path, no processing occurs.

    When preprocessing visits a node containing an identifier, that identifier
    must be used as the base URI to process child nodes.

    It is an error for more than one object in a document to have the same
    absolute URI.

    ### Example

    The `id` field is the identifier field in the following example.

    ```
    {
      "@context": {
        "acid": "http://example.com/acid#"
      },
      "id": "http://example.com/base",
      "form": {
        "id": "one",
        "things": [
          {
            "id": "two"
          },
          {
            "id": "#three",
          },
          {
            "id": "four#five",
          },
          {
            "id": "acid:six",
          }
        ]
      }
    }

    ```

    Becomes:

    ```
    {
      "id": "http://example.com/base",
      "form": {
        "id": "http://example.com/base#one",
        "things": [
          {
            "id": "http://example.com/base#one/two"
          },
          {
            "id": "http://example.com/base#three"
          },
          {
            "id": "http://example.com/base#one/four#five",
          },
          {
            "id": "http://example.com/acid#six",
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

    ## Link resolution

    The schema may designate one or more fields as link fields reference other
    objects.  Processing must resolve links to either absolute URIs using the
    following rules:

      * If a reference URI is prefixed with `#` it is a relative
      fragment identifier.  It is resolved relative to the base URI by setting
      or replacing the fragment portion of the base URI.

      * If a reference URI does not contain a scheme and is not prefixed with
      `#` it is a path relative reference.  If the reference URI contains `#`
      in any position other than the first character, the reference URI must be
      divided into a path portion and a fragment portion split on the first
      instance of `#`.  The path portion is resolved relative to the base URI
      by the following rule: if the path portion of the base URI ends in a
      slash `/`, append the path portion of the reference URI to the path
      portion of the base URI.  If the path portion of the base URI does not
      end in a slash, replace the final path segment with the path portion of
      the reference URI.  Replace the fragment portion of the base URI with the
      fragment portion of the reference URI.

      * If a reference URI begins with a namespace prefix declared in
      `@context` followed by a colon `:`, the prefix and colon must be replaced
      by the namespace declared in `@context`.

      * If a reference URI is an absolute URI consisting of a scheme and path,
        no processing occurs.

    Link resolution must not affect the base URI used to resolve identifiers
    and other links.

    ### Example

    The `link` field is the reference field in the following example.  The
    base URI is `http://example.com/base`

    ```
    {
      "@context": {
        "link": {
          "@id": "http://example.com/link"
          "@type": "@id"
        },
        "acid": "http://example.com/acid#"
      },
      "link": "http://example.com/base/zero",
      "form": {
        "link": "one",
        "things": [
          {
            "link": "two"
          },
          {
            "link": "#three",
          },
          {
            "link": "four#five",
          },
          {
            "link": "acid:six",
          }
        ]
      }
    }

    ```

    Becomes:

    ```
    {
      "link": "http://example.com/base/zero",
      "form": {
        "link": "http://example.com/one",
        "things": [
          {
            "link": "http://example.com/two"
          },
          {
            "link": "http://example.com/base#three"
          },
          {
            "link": "http://example.com/four#five",
          },
          {
            "link": "http://example.com/acid#six",
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

    ## Vocabulary resolution

    The schema may designate one or more vocabulary fields which use terms
    defined in the vocabulary.  Processing must resolve vocabulary fields to
    either vocabulary terms or absolute URIs by first applying the link
    resolution rules defined above, then applying the following additional
    rule:

      * If a reference URI is a vocabulary field, and there is a vocabulary
      term which maps to the resolved URI, the reference must be replace with
      the vocabulary term.

    ### Example

    ```
    {
      "@context": {
        "voc": {
          "@id": "http://example.com/link"
          "@type": "@vocab"
        },
        "red": "http://example.com/acid#red"
      },
      "form": {
        "things": [
          {
            "voc": "red",
          },
          {
            "voc": "http://example.com/acid#red",
          },
          {
            "voc": "http://example.com/acid#blue",
          }
        ]
      }
    }

    ```

    Becomes:

    ```
    {
      "form": {
        "things": [
          {
            "voc": "red",
          },
          {
            "voc": "red",
          },
          {
            "voc": "http://example.com/acid#blue",
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

    ## Import

    During preprocessing traversal, an implementation must resolve `@import`
    directives.  An `@import` directive is an object consisting of exactly one
    field `@import` specifying resource by URI string.  It is an error if there
    are additional fields in the `@import` object, such additional fields must
    be ignored.

    The URI string must be resolved to an absolute URI using the link
    resolution rules described previously.  Implementations must support
    loading from `file`, `http` and `https` resources.  The URI referenced by
    `@import` must be loaded and recursively preprocessed as a Salad document.
    The external imported document does not inherit the context of the
    importing document, and the default base URI for processing the imported
    document must be the URI used to retrieve the imported document.  If the
    `@import` URI includes a document fragment, the fragment must be excluded
    from the base URI used to preprocess the imported document.

    Once loaded and processed, the `@import` node is replaced in the document
    structure by the object or array yielded from the import operation.

    URIs may reference document fragments which refer to specific an object in
    the target document.  This indicates that the `@import` node must be
    replaced by only the object with the appropriate fragment identifier.

    It is a fatal error if an import directive refers to an external resource
    or resource fragment which does not exist or is not accessible.

    ### Example

    import.yml:
    ```
    {
      "hello": "world"
    }

    ```

    parent.yml:
    ```
    {
      "form": {
        "bar": {
          "@import": "import.yml"
          }
      }
    }

    ```

    Becomes:

    ```
    {
      "form": {
        "bar": {
          "hello": "world"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    ## Include

    During preprocessing traversal, an implementation must resolve `@include`
    directives.  An `@include` directive is an object consisting of exactly one
    field `@include` specifying a URI string.  It is an error if there are
    additional fields in the `@include` object, such additional fields must be
    ignored.

    The URI string must be resolved to an absolute URI using the link
    resolution rules described previously.  The URI referenced by `@include` must
    be loaded as a text data.  Implementations must support loading from
    `file`, `http` and `https` resources.  Implementations may transcode the
    character encoding of the text data to match that of the parent document,
    but must not interpret or parse the text document in any other way.

    Once loaded, the `@include` node is replaced in the document structure by a
    string containing the text data loaded from the resource.

    It is a fatal error if an import directive refers to an external resource
    which does not exist or is not accessible.

    ### Example

    parent.yml:
    ```
    {
      "form": {
        "bar": {
          "@include": "include.txt"
          }
      }
    }

    ```

    include.txt:
    ```
    hello world

    ```

    Becomes:

    ```
    {
      "form": {
        "bar": "hello world"
      }
    }
    ```

    # Link validation

    Once a document has been preprocessed, an implementation may validate
    links.  The link validation traversal may visit fields which the schema
    designates as link fields and check that each URI references an existing
    object in the current document, an imported document, file system, or
    network resource.  Failure to validate links may be a fatal error.  Link
    validation behavior for individual fields may be modified by `identity` and
    `noLinkCheck` in the `jsonldPredicate` section of the field schema.

   Salad data types are based on Avro schema declarations.  Refer to the
   [Avro schema declaration documentation](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/spec.html#schemas) for
   detailed information.

   ## Simple types

   * **null**: no value
   * **boolean**: a binary value
   * **int**: 32-bit signed integer
   * **long**: 64-bit signed integer
   * **float**: single precision (32-bit) IEEE 754 floating-point number
   * **double**: double precision (64-bit) IEEE 754 floating-point number
   * **string**: Unicode character sequence


- name: "Any"
  type: enum
  symbols: ["#Any"]
  doc: |
    The **Any** type validates for any non-null value.


- name: JsonldPredicate
  type: record
  doc: |
    Attached to a record field to define how the parent record field is handled for
    URI resolution and JSON-LD context generation.
  fields:
    - name: _id
      type: ["null", string]
      jsonldPredicate:
        _id: sld:_id
        _type: "@id"
        identity: true
      doc: |
        The predicate URI that this field corresponds to.
        Corresponds to JSON-LD `@id` directive.
    - name: _type
      type: ["null", string]
      doc: |
        The context type hint, corresponds to JSON-LD `@type` directive.

        * If the value of this field is `@id` and `identity` is false or
        unspecified, the parent field must be resolved using the link
        resolution rules.  If `identity` is true, the parent field must be
        resolved using the identifier expandsion rules.

        * If the value of this field is `@vocab`, the parent field must be
          resolved using the vocabulary resolution rules.

    - name: _container
      type: ["null", string]
      doc: |
        Structure hint, corresponds to JSON-LD `@container` directive.
    - name: identity
      type: ["null", boolean]
      doc: |
        If true and `_type` is `@id` this indicates that the parent field must
        be resolved according to identity resolution rules instead of link
        resolution rules.  In addition, the field value is considered an
        assertion that the linked value exists; absence of an object in the loaded document
        with the URI is not an error.
    - name: noLinkCheck
      type: ["null", boolean]
      doc: |
        If true, this indicates that link validation traversal must stop at
        this field.  This field (it is is a URI) or any fields under it (if it
        is an object or array) are not subject to link checking.

        for this type should appear in a subsection under `docParent`.
      jsonldPredicate:
        _id: "sld:docParent"
        _type: "@id"

    - name: docAfter
      type: ["null", string]
      doc: |
        Hint to indicate that during documentation generation, documentation
        for this type should appear after the `docAfter` section at the same
        level.
      jsonldPredicate:
        _id: "sld:docAfter"
        _type: "@id"
