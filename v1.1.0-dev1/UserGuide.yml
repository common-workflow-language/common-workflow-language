      # Wrapping Command Line Tools

    - |
      ## First example

      The simplest "hello world" program.  This accepts one input parameter,
      writes a message to the terminal or job log, and produces no permanent
      output.  CWL documents are written in [JSON](http://json.org) or
      [YAML](http://yaml.org), or a mix of the two.

      *1st-tool.cwl*
      ```
    - $include: examples/1st-tool.cwl
    - |
      ```

      Use a YAML object in a separate file to describe the input of a run:

      *echo-job.yml*
      ```
    - $include: examples/echo-job.yml
    - |
      ```

      Now invoke `cwl-runner` with the tool wrapper and the input object on the
      command line:

      ```
      $ cwl-runner 1st-tool.cwl echo-job.yml
      [job 140199012414352] $ echo 'Hello world!'
      Hello world!
      Final process status is success
      ```

      What's going on here?  Let's break it down:

      ```
      cwlVersion: v1.1.0-dev1
      class: CommandLineTool
      ```

      The `cwlVersion` field indicates the version of the CWL spec used by the
      document.  The `class` field indicates this document describes a command
      line tool.

      ```
      baseCommand: echo
      ```

      The `baseCommand` provides the name of program that will actually run
      (echo)

      ```
      inputs:
        message:
          type: string
          inputBinding:
            position: 1
      ```

      The `inputs` section describes the inputs of the tool.  This is a list of input
      parameters and each parameter includes an identifier, a data type, and
      optionally an `inputBinding` which describes how this input parameter
      should appear on the command line.  In this example, the `position` field
      indicates where it should appear on the command line.

      ```
      outputs: []
      ```

      This tool has no formal output, so the `outputs` section is an empty list.

    - |
      ## Essential input parameters

      The `inputs` of a tool is a list of input parameters that control how to
      run the tool.  Each parameter has an `id` for the name of parameter, and
      `type` describing what types of values are valid for that parameter.

      Available primitive types are *string*, *int*, *long*, *float*, *double*,
      and *null*; complex types are *array* and *record*; in addition there are
      special types *File*, *Directory* and *Any*.

      The following example demonstrates some input parameters with different
      types and appearing on the command line in different ways:


      *inp.cwl*
      ```
    - $include: examples/inp.cwl
    - |
      ```

      *inp-job.yml*
      ```
    - $include: examples/inp-job.yml
    - |
      ```

      Notice that "example_file", as a `File` type, must be provided as an
      object with the fields `class: File` and `path`.

      Next, create a whale.txt and invoke `cwl-runner` with the tool wrapper and the input object on the
      command line:

      ```
      $ touch whale.txt
      $ cwl-runner inp.cwl inp-job.yml
      [job 140020149614160] /home/example$ echo -f -i42 --example-string hello --file=/home/example/whale.txt
      -f -i42 --example-string hello --file=/home/example/whale.txt
      Final process status is success
      ```

      The field `inputBinding` is optional and indicates whether and how the
      input parameter should be appear on the tool's command line.  If
      `inputBinding` is missing, the parameter does not appear on the command
      line.  Let's look at each example in detail.

      ```
      example_flag:
        type: boolean
        inputBinding:
          position: 1
          prefix: -f
      ```

      Boolean types are treated as a flag.  If the input parameter
      "example_flag" is "true", then `prefix` will be added to the
      command line.  If false, no flag is added.

      ```
      example_string:
        type: string
        inputBinding:
          position: 3
          prefix: --example-string
      ```

      String types appear on the command line as literal values.  The `prefix`
      is optional, if provided, it appears as a separate argument on the
      command line before the parameter .  In the example above, this is
      rendered as `--example-string hello`.

      ```
      example_int:
        type: int
        inputBinding:
          position: 2
          prefix: -i
          separate: false
      ```

      Integer (and floating point) types appear on the command line with
      decimal text representation.  When the option `separate` is false (the
      default value is true), the prefix and value are combined into a single
      argument.  In the example above, this is rendered as `-i42`.


      ```
      example_file:
        type: File?
        inputBinding:
          prefix: --file=
          separate: false
          position: 4
      ```

      File types appear on the command line as the path to the file.  When the
      parameter type ends with a question mark `?` it indicates that the
      parameter is optional.  In the example above, this is rendered as
      `--file=/home/example/whale.txt`.  However, if the "example_file"
      parameter were not provided in the input, nothing would appear on the
      command line.

      Input files are read-only.  If you wish to update an input file, you must
      first copy it to the output directory.

      The value of `position` is used to determine where parameter should
      appear on the command line.  Positions are relative to one another, not
      abosolute.  As a result, positions do not have to be sequential, three
      parameters with positions `[1, 3, 5]` will result in the same command
      line as `[1, 2, 3]`.  More than one parameter can have the same position
      (ties are broken using the parameter name), and the position field itself
      is optional.  the default position is 0.

      The `baseCommand` field always comes before parameters.

    - |
      ## Returning output files

      The `outputs` of a tool is a list of output parameters that should be
      returned after running the tool.  Each parameter has an `id` for the name
      of parameter, and `type` describing what types of values are valid for
      that parameter.

      When a tool runs under CWL, the starting working directory is the
      designated output directory.  The underlying tool or script must record
      its results in the form of files created in the output directory.  The
      output parameters returned by the CWL tool are either the output files
      themselves, or come from examining the content of those files.

      *tar.cwl*
      ```
    - $include: examples/tar.cwl
    - |
      ```

      *tar-job.yml*
      ```
    - $include: examples/tar-job.yml
    - |
      ```

      Next, create a tar file for the example and invoke `cwl-runner` with the tool wrapper and the input object on the
      command line:
      ```
      $ touch hello.txt && tar -cvf hello.tar hello.txt
      $ cwl-runner tar.cwl tar-job.yml
      [job 139868145165200] $ tar xf /home/example/hello.tar
      Final process status is success
      {
      "example_out": {
        "location": "hello.txt",
        "size": 13,
        "class": "File",
        "checksum": "sha1$47a013e660d408619d894b20806b1d5086aab03b"
        }
      }
      ```

      The field `outputBinding` describes how to to set the value of each
      output parameter.

      ```
      outputs:
        - id: example_out
          type: File
          outputBinding:
            glob: hello.txt
      ```

      The `glob` field consists of the name of a file in the output directory.
      If you don't know name of the file in advance, you can use a wildcard
      pattern.

    - |
      ## Capturing a tool's standard output stream

      To capture a tool's standard output stream, add the `stdout` field with
      the name of the file where the output stream should go.  Then add `type:
      stdout` on the corresponding output parameter.

      *stdout.cwl*
      ```
    - $include: examples/stdout.cwl
    - |
      ```

      *echo-job.yml*
      ```
    - $include: examples/echo-job.yml
    - |
      ```

      Now invoke `cwl-runner` providing the tool wrapper and the input object
      on the command line:

      ```
      $ cwl-runner stdout.cwl echo-job.yml
      [job 140199012414352] $ echo 'Hello world!' > output.txt
      Final process status is success
      {
      "output": {
        "location": "output.txt",
        "size": 13,
        "class": "File",
        "checksum": "sha1$47a013e660d408619d894b20806b1d5086aab03b"
        }
      }
      $ cat output.txt
      Hello world!
      ```

    - |
      ## Parameter references

      In a previous example, we used extracted a file using the "tar" program.
      However, that example was very limited becuase it assumed that the file
      we were interested in was called "hello.txt".  In this example, you will
      see how to reference the value of input parameters dynamically from other
      fields.

      *tar-param.cwl*
      ```
    - $include: examples/tar-param.cwl
    - |
      ```

      *tar-param-job.yml*
      ```
    - $include: examples/tar-param-job.yml
    - |
      ```

      Create your input files and invoke `cwl-runner` with the tool wrapper and the input object on the
      command line:
      ```
      $ rm hello.tar || true && touch goodbye.txt && tar -cvf hello.tar goodbye.txt
      $ cwl-runner tar-param.cwl tar-param-job.yml
      [job 139868145165200] $ tar xf /home/example/hello.tar goodbye.txt
      Final process status is success
      {
      "example_out": {
        "location": "goodbye.txt",
        "size": 24,
        "class": "File",
        "checksum": "sha1$dd0a4c4c49ba43004d6611771972b6cf969c1c01"
        }
      }
      ```

      Certain fields permit parameter references which are enclosed in `$(...)`.
      These are evaluated and replaced with value being referenced.

      ```
      outputs:
        example_out:
          type: File
          outputBinding:
            glob: $(inputs.extractfile)
      ```

      References are written using a subset of Javascript syntax.  In this
      example, `$(inputs.extractfile)`, `$(inputs["extractfile"])`, and
      `$(inputs['extractfile'])` are equivalent.

      The value of the "inputs" variable is the input object provided when the
      CWL tool was invoked.

      Note that because File parameters are objects, to get the path to an
      input file you must reference the path field on a file object; to
      reference the path to the tar file in the above example you would write
      `$(inputs.tarfile.path)`.

    - |
      ## Running tools inside Docker

      [Docker](http://docker.io) containers simplify software installation by providing a complete
      known-good runtime for software and its dependencies.  However,
      containers are also purposefully isolated from the host system, so in
      order to run a tool inside a Docker container there is additional work to
      ensure that input files are available inside the container and output
      files can be recovered from the contianer.  CWL can perform this work
      automatically, allowing you to use Docker to simplify your software
      management while avoiding the complexity of invoking and managing Docker
      containers.

      This example runs a simple Node.js script inside a Docker container.

      *docker.cwl*
      ```
    - $include: examples/docker.cwl
    - |
      ```

      *docker-job.yml*
      ```
    - $include: examples/docker-job.yml
    - |
      ```

      Provide a hello.js and invoke `cwl-runner` providing the tool wrapper and the input object
      on the command line:

      ```
      $ echo "console.log(\"Hello World\");" > hello.js
      $ cwl-runner docker.cwl docker-job.yml
      [job 140259721854416] /home/example$ docker run -i --volume=/home/example/hello.js:/var/lib/cwl/job369354770_examples/hello.js:ro --volume=/home/example:/var/spool/cwl:rw --volume=/tmp/tmpDLs5hm:/tmp:rw --workdir=/var/spool/cwl --read-only=true --net=none --user=1001 --rm --env=TMPDIR=/tmp node:slim node /var/lib/cwl/job369354770_examples/hello.js
      Hello world!
      Final process status is success
      ```

      Notice the CWL runner has constructed a Docker command line to run the
      script.  One of the responsibilies of the CWL runner is to the paths of
      input files to reflect the location where they appear inside the
      container.  In this example, the path to the script `hello.js` is
      `/home/example/hello.js` outside the container but
      `/var/lib/cwl/job369354770_examples/hello.js` inside the container, as
      reflected in the invocation of the `node` command.

    - |
      ## Additional command line arguments and runtime parameters

      Sometimes tools require additional command line options that don't
      correspond exactly to input parameters.

      In this example, we will wrap the Java compiler to compile a java source
      file to a class file.  By default, `javac` will create the class files in
      the same directory as the source file.  However, CWL input files (and the
      directories in which they appear) may be read-only, so we need to
      instruct javac to write the class file to the designated output directory
      instead.

      *arguments.cwl*
      ```
    - $include: examples/arguments.cwl
    - |
      ```

      *arguments-job.yml*
      ```
    - $include: examples/arguments-job.yml
    - |
      ```

      Now create a sample Java file and invoke `cwl-runner` providing the tool wrapper and the input object
      on the command line:

      ```
      $ echo "public class Hello {}" > Hello.java
      $ cwl-runner arguments.cwl arguments-job.yml
      [job arguments.cwl] /tmp/tmpwYALo1$ docker \
       run \
       -i \
       --volume=/home/peter/work/common-workflow-language/v1.1.0-dev1/examples/Hello.java:/var/lib/cwl/stg8939ac04-7443-4990-a518-1855b2322141/Hello.java:ro \
       --volume=/tmp/tmpwYALo1:/var/spool/cwl:rw \
       --volume=/tmp/tmpptIAJ8:/tmp:rw \
       --workdir=/var/spool/cwl \
       --read-only=true \
       --user=1001 \
       --rm \
       --env=TMPDIR=/tmp \
       --env=HOME=/var/spool/cwl \
       java:7 \
       javac \
       -d \
       /var/spool/cwl \
       /var/lib/cwl/stg8939ac04-7443-4990-a518-1855b2322141/Hello.java
      Final process status is success
      {
        "classfile": {
          "size": 416,
          "location": "/home/example/Hello.class",
          "checksum": "sha1$2f7ac33c1f3aac3f1fec7b936b6562422c85b38a",
          "class": "File"
        }
      }

      ```

      Here we use the `arguments` field to add an additional argument to the
      command line that isn't tied to a specific input parameter.

      ```
      arguments: ["-d", $(runtime.outdir)]
      ```

      This example references a runtime parameter.  Runtime parameters
      provide information about the hardware or software environment when the
      tool is actually executed.  The `$(runtime.outdir)` parameter is the path
      to the designated output directory.  Other parameters include
      `$(runtime.tmpdir)`, `$(runtime.ram)`, `$(runtime.cores)`,
      `$(runtime.ram)`, `$(runtime.outdirSize)`, and `$(runtime.tmpdirSize)`.  See
      the [Runtime Environment](CommandLineTool.html#Runtime_environment)
      section of the CWL specification for details.

    - |
      ## Array inputs

      It is easy to add arrays of input parameters represented to the command
      line.  To specify an array parameter, the array definition is nested
      under the `type` field with `type: array` and `items` defining the valid
      data types that may appear in the array.

      *array-inputs.cwl*
      ```
    - $include: examples/array-inputs.cwl
    - |
      ```

      *array-inputs-job.yml*
      ```
    - $include: examples/array-inputs-job.yml
    - |
      ```

      Now invoke `cwl-runner` providing the tool wrapper and the input object
      on the command line:

      ```
      $ cwl-runner array-inputs.cwl array-inputs-job.yml
      [job 140334923640912] /home/example$ echo -A one two three -B=four -B=five -B=six -C=seven,eight,nine
      -A one two three -B=four -B=five -B=six -C=seven,eight,nine
      Final process status is success
      {}
      ```

      The `inputBinding` can appear either on the outer array parameter
      definition or the inner array element definition, and these produce
      different behavior when constructing the command line, as shown above.
      In addition, the `itemSeperator` field, if provided, specifies that array
      values should be concatenated into a single argument separated by the
      item separator string.

      You can specify arrays of arrays, arrays of records, and other complex
      types.

    - |
      ## Array outputs

      You can also capture multiple output files into an array of files using `glob`.

      *array-outputs.cwl*
      ```
    - $include: examples/array-outputs.cwl
    - |
      ```

      *array-outpust-job.yml*
      ```
    - $include: examples/array-outputs-job.yml
    - |
      ```

      Now invoke `cwl-runner` providing the tool wrapper and the input object
      on the command line:

      ```
      $ cwl-runner array-outputs.cwl array-outputs-job.yml
      [job 140190876078160] /home/example$ touch foo.txt bar.dat baz.txt
      Final process status is success
      {
        "output": [
          {
            "size": 0,
            "location": "/home/peter/work/common-workflow-language/draft-3/examples/foo.txt",
            "checksum": "sha1$da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709",
            "class": "File"
          },
          {
            "size": 0,
            "location": "/home/peter/work/common-workflow-language/draft-3/examples/baz.txt",
            "checksum": "sha1$da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709",
            "class": "File"
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

    - |
      ## Record inputs, dependent and mutually exclusive parameters

      Sometimes an underlying tool has several arguments that must be provided
      together (they are dependent) or several arguments that cannot be
      provided together (they are exclusive).  You can use records and type
      unions to group parameters together to describe these two conditions.

      *record.cwl*
      ```
    - $include: examples/record.cwl
    - |
      ```

      *record-job1.yml*
      ```
    - $include: examples/record-job1.yml
    - |
      ```

      ```
      $ cwl-runner record.cwl record-job1.yml
      Workflow error:
        Error validating input record, could not validate field `dependent_parameters` because
        missing required field `itemB`
      ```

      In the first example, you can't provide `itemA` without also providing `itemB`.

      *record-job2.yml*
      ```
    - $include: examples/record-job2.yml
    - |
      ```

      ```
      $ cwl-runner record.cwl record-job2.yml
      [job 140566927111376] /home/example$ echo -A one -B two -C three
      -A one -B two -C three
      Final process status is success
      {}
      ```

      In the second example, `itemC` and `itemD` are exclusive, so only `itemC`
      is added to the command line and `itemD` is ignored.

      *record-job3.yml*
      ```
    - $include: examples/record-job3.yml
    - |
      ```

      ```
      $ cwl-runner record.cwl record-job3.yml
      [job 140606932172880] /home/example$ echo -A one -B two -D four
      -A one -B two -D four
      Final process status is success
      {}
      ```

      In the third example, only `itemD` is provided, so it appears on the
      command line.

      ## Environment variables

      Tools run in a restricted environment and do not inherit most environment
      variables from the parent process.  You can set environment variables for
      the tool using `EnvVarRequirement`.

      *env.cwl*
      ```
    - $include: examples/env.cwl
    - |
      ```

      *echo-job.yml*
      ```
    - $include: examples/echo-job.yml
    - |
      ```

      Now invoke `cwl-runner` with the tool wrapper and the input object on the
      command line:

      ```
      $ cwl-runner env.cwl echo-job.yml
      [job 140710387785808] /home/example$ env
      PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
      HELLO=Hello world!
      TMPDIR=/tmp/tmp63Obpk
      Final process status is success
      {}
      ```

      ## Javascript expressions

      If you need to manipulate input parameters, include the requirement
      `InlineJavascriptRequirement` and then anywhere a parameter reference is
      legal you can provide a fragment of Javascript that will be evaluated by
      the CWL runner.

      *expression.cwl*
      ```
    - $include: examples/expression.cwl
    - |
      ```

      ```
      $ cwl-runner expression.cwl empty.yml
      [job 140000594593168] /home/example$ echo -A 2 -B baz -C 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
      -A 2 -B baz -C 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
      Final process status is success
      {}
      ```

      You can only use expressions in certain fields.  These are: `filename`,
      `fileContent`, `envValue`, `valueFrom`, `glob`, `outputEval`, `stdin`,
      `stdout`, `coresMin`, `coresMax`, `ramMin`, `ramMax`, `tmpdirMin`,
      `tmpdirMax`, `outdirMin`, and `outdirMax`.

      ## Creating files at runtime

      Sometimes you need to create a file on the fly from input parameters,
      such as tools which expect to read their input configuration from a file
      rather than the command line parameters.  To do this, use
      `InitialWorkDirRequirement`.

      *createfile.cwl*
      ```
    - $include: examples/createfile.cwl
    - |
      ```

      *echo-job.yml*
      ```
    - $include: examples/echo-job.yml
    - |
      ```

      Now invoke `cwl-runner` with the tool wrapper and the input object on the
      command line:

      ```
      $ cwltool createfile.cwl echo-job.yml
      [job 140528604979344] /home/example$ cat example.conf
      CONFIGVAR=Hello world!
      Final process status is success
      {}
      ```

      ## Staging input files in the output directory

      Normally, input files are located in a read-only directory separate from
      the output directory.  This causes problems if the underlying tool
      expects to write its output files alongside the input file in the same
      directory.  You use `InitialWorkDirRequirement` to stage input files into the
      output directory.  In this example, we use a Javascript expression to
      extract the base name of the input file from its leading directory path.

      *linkfile.cwl*
      ```
    - $include: examples/linkfile.cwl
    - |
      ```

      *arguments-job.yml*
      ```
    - $include: examples/arguments-job.yml
    - |
      ```

      Now invoke `cwl-runner` with the tool wrapper and the input object on the
      command line:

      ```
      $ cwl-runner linkfile.cwl arguments-job.yml
      [job 139928309171664] /home/example$ docker run -i --volume=/home/example/Hello.java:/var/lib/cwl/job557617295_examples/Hello.java:ro --volume=/home/example:/var/spool/cwl:rw --volume=/tmp/tmpmNbApw:/tmp:rw --workdir=/var/spool/cwl --read-only=true --net=none --user=1001 --rm --env=TMPDIR=/tmp java:7 javac Hello.java
      Final process status is success
      {
      "classfile": {
        "size": 416,
        "location": "/home/example/Hello.class",
        "checksum": "sha1$2f7ac33c1f3aac3f1fec7b936b6562422c85b38a",
        "class": "File"
        }
      }
      ```

      # Writing Workflows

      ## First workflow

      This workflow extracts a java source file from a tar file and then
      compiles it.

      *1st-workflow.cwl*
      ```
    - $include: examples/1st-workflow.cwl
    - |
      ```

      Use a JSON object in a separate file to describe the input of a run:

      *1st-workflow-job.yml*
      ```
    - $include: examples/1st-workflow-job.yml
    - |
      ```

      Now invoke `cwl-runner` with the tool wrapper and the input object on the
      command line:

      ```
      $ echo "public class Hello {}" > Hello.java && tar -cvf hello.tar Hello.java
      $ cwl-runner 1st-workflow.cwl 1st-workflow-job.yml
      [job untar] /tmp/tmp94qFiM$ tar xf /home/example/hello.tar Hello.java
      [step untar] completion status is success
      [job compile] /tmp/tmpu1iaKL$ docker run -i --volume=/tmp/tmp94qFiM/Hello.java:/var/lib/cwl/job301600808_tmp94qFiM/Hello.java:ro --volume=/tmp/tmpu1iaKL:/var/spool/cwl:rw --volume=/tmp/tmpfZnNdR:/tmp:rw --workdir=/var/spool/cwl --read-only=true --net=none --user=1001 --rm --env=TMPDIR=/tmp java:7 javac -d /var/spool/cwl /var/lib/cwl/job301600808_tmp94qFiM/Hello.java
      [step compile] completion status is success
      [workflow 1st-workflow.cwl] outdir is /home/example
      Final process status is success
      {
        "classout": {
          "location": "/home/example/Hello.class",
          "checksum": "sha1$e68df795c0686e9aa1a1195536bd900f5f417b18",
          "class": "File",
          "size": 416
        }
      }
      ```

      What's going on here?  Let's break it down:

      ```
      cwlVersion: v1.1.0-dev1
      class: Workflow
      ```

      The 'cwlVersion` field indicates the version of the CWL spec used by the
      document.  The `class` field indicates this document describes a workflow.


      ```
      inputs:
        inp: File
        ex: string
      ```

      The `inputs` section describes the inputs of the workflow.  This is a
      list of input parameters where each parameter consists of an identifier
      and a data type.  These parameters can be used as sources for input to
      specific workflows steps.

      ```
      outputs:
        classout:
          type: File
          outputSource: compile/classfile
      ```

      The `outputs` section describes the outputs of the workflow.  This is a
      list of output parameters where each parameter consists of an identifier
      and a data type.  The `source` connects the output parameter `classfile`
      of the `compile` step to the workflow output parameter `classout`.

      ```
      steps:
        untar:
          run: tar-param.cwl
          in:
            tarfile: inp
            extractfile: ex
          outputs: [example_out]
      ```

      The `steps` section describes the actual steps of the workflow.  In this
      example, the first step extracts a file from a tar file, and the second
      step compiles the file from the first step using the java compiler.
      Workflow steps are not necessarily run in the order they are listed,
      instead the order is determined by the dependencies between steps (using
      `source`).  In addition, workflow steps which do not depend on one
      another may run in parallel.

      The first step, `untar` runs `tar-param.cwl` (described previously in
      [Parameter references](#Parameter_references)).  This tool has two input
      parameters, `tarfile` and `extractfile` and one output parameter
      `example_out`.

      The `inputs` section of the workflow step connects these two input
      parameters to the inputs of the workflow, `inp` and `ex` using
      `source`.  This means that when the workflow step is executed, the values
      assigned to `inp` and `ex` will be used for the parameters `tarfile`
      and `extractfile` in order to run the tool.

      The `outputs` section of the workflow step lists the output parameters
      that are expected from the tool.

      ```
        compile:
          run: arguments.cwl
          in:
            src: untar/example_out
          outputs: [classfile]
      ```

      The second step `compile` depends on the results from the first step by
      connecting the input parameter `src` to the output parameter of `untar`
      using `untar/example_out`.  The output of this step `classfile` is
      connected to the `outputs` section for the Workflow, described above.
